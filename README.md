# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques: A Comparative Study

## Overview
This project explores and compares various dimensionality reduction techniques, providing implementations for both image and tabular datasets. The goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques in reducing high-dimensional data into meaningful lower-dimensional representations while preserving key features and relationships.

## Objectives
- Implement and visualize dimensionality reduction techniques using Python and Jupyter notebooks.
- Compare the performance of these techniques across distinct datasets.
- Provide interactive visualizations for t-SNE and UMAP.
- Demonstrate implementations in Databricks for scalability.
